# GJ1151_SPI
Custom code that went into creating plots for the paper "Coherent radio emission from a quiescent red dwarf indicative of star-planet interaction"

The calculations closedly follow the formalism in Saur 2013 and Turnpenney 2018. 
The two files plot the star-ward Poynting flux for the open (Parker spiral) and closed (dipolar) field configurations.
Note that several parameters have been hardcoded for the case of GJ1151, in particular the Poynting flux inferred from the measured flux density of the source. Other hardcoded parameters can be changed by editing the variable declarations in the beginning lines of the code.
